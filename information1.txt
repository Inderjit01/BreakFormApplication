<p>Special Services Group LLC (SSG) requires all employees to take rest periods as required by applicable law. SSG schedules work and job duties to ensure that every employee is able to take all required rest periods. It is the responsibility of each employee to ensure that all required rest periods are taken. Employees are not permitted to skip, delay or reduce the required length of any rest period and are not permitted to perform any work during any rest period. Rest periods are counted as time worked and employees are paid for the time they spend on rest periods.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of our operation, SSG cannot closely monitor when each and every rest period is taken. If you think you may not be able to take a rest period, you must notify your supervisor immediately so SSG can work with you to ensure that you take the required rest period. If you do not work more than 3.5 hours in a workday, you may waive your right to take a rest period if you would like. For days on which you work more than 3.5 hours, you are required, authorized and permitted to take 1 uninterrupted and duty-free 10-minute rest period for every 4 hours worked or major fraction thereof (anything over 2 hours). Rest periods shall be taken as close to the middle of each work period as practicable. Employees may not combine rest periods or use rest periods as a basis for starting work late, leaving work early, or extending a meal period.  The number of rest periods required to be taken every day is based on the number of hours you work, as shown on the following chart:</p>
