<p>Employees are relieved of all duties during rest periods, are not permitted to work “off the clock,” including during rest periods, and should not consider themselves to be on-call during any rest period. Additionally, if a Non-Exempt Employee who is on a rest period receives a work-related call, text message or e-mail, the employee is not expected to review, answer or respond.</p>

<p>Any employee who does not take a required and legally compliant rest period, or who is in any way discouraged or prohibited from taking a compliant rest period, shall notify your supervisor and complete a Non-Compliant Meal and/or Rest Period Form on the day in which the rest period was non-compliant so SSG can determine whether it is appropriate to provide the employee with a Rest Period Premium. If you do not properly notify SSG that a rest period was non-compliant and complete a Non-Compliant Meal and/or Rest Period Form, SSG will assume that you have received and actually took compliant rest periods and SSG will not provide you with a Rest Period Premium. An employee who voluntarily skips or takes a non-compliant rest period despite being given the opportunity to take a timely, complete and uninterrupted rest period, is not entitled to receive a Rest Period Premium.</p>

<p><b>The purpose of this form is to ensure all employees have the opportunity to confirm whether they have taken legally compliant rest periods or have not been able to do so as a result of operational needs and are therefore entitled to receive a Rest Period Premium.  Please complete this form honestly for each day that you worked during the workweek by initialing in the appropriate box.<b></p>
